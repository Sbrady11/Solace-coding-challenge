## Hey there and thanks for the opportunity to apply!
---
There were a few things that I wanted to hop into - I got a little bogged down with reading into drizzle (my bad ha!), and ran into my 2 hour mark.
- Pagination: love me some pagination in search, and maybe drop in some load on scroll 
- Error handling: something back from the backend to let me know if its just an empty array OR if something else went wrong
- Better query perf and full text search - so these ILIKE statements wont scale... or at least I dont think so! I was poking into more drizzle stuff past the guides (used them to peek the available functionality and syntax for filters n what not), and read into full text search empowered by tsvectors. I'd encountered these before in chats with the rest of the team at my old company but hadn't implemented them myself... Alas was running against the clock so I wanted to pass in something that would at least get the search off the ground with queries AWAY from the front end and closer to the data source.

also woof, it would have been nice to do more styling. I've been a styled components lad (mostly emotion), but they're really losing ground against other design systems and structures. I dont mind tailwind at all! It's just that there were only a couple grids to set in this ultra minimal update. ALAS! Happy I got branding in at least.

This was fun, thanks for this, and thanks for the consideration.

best,
Simon
